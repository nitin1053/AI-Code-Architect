# 🚀 Deployment Guide

## ✅ Successfully Pushed to GitHub!

Your repository is now live at: **https://github.com/nitin1053/AI-Code-Architect**

---

## 🌐 Deploy to GitHub Pages

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages (One-Time Setup)

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/nitin1053/AI-Code-Architect
2. Click **Settings**
3. Scroll down to **Pages** in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. Save the settings

### Step 2: Push Your Changes

The GitHub Actions workflow is already configured! Just push:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Configure GitHub Pages deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Automatic Deployment

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
- ✅ Build your app
- ✅ Deploy to GitHub Pages
- ✅ Make it live at: `https://nitin1053.github.io/AI-Code-Architect/`

---

## 📍 Your Live URLs

### Local Development:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### GitHub Pages (after deployment):
```
https://nitin1053.github.io/AI-Code-Architect/
```

### GitHub Repository:
```
https://github.com/nitin1053/AI-Code-Architect
```

---

## 🔄 Automatic Deployment

Every time you push to `main` branch, your site will automatically redeploy!

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin main
```

---

## 🛠️ Manual Build

If you want to test the production build locally:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
