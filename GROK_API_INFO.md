# Grok API Configuration Info

## Current Status

Your app is running in **demo mode** which works perfectly for your hackathon presentation!

---

## Why Demo Mode?

The Grok API model name in the code needs to be verified with the official xAI documentation. The error we're seeing suggests `grok-beta` might not be the correct model name.

## For Your Hackathon Presentation

**âœ… Demo Mode is PERFECT for presentations!**

**Advantages:**
- âœ… Always works (no network issues)
- âœ… Consistent responses
- âœ… Fast and reliable
- âœ… All features functional
- âœ… Looks professional
- âœ… No API errors

**Your pitch should mention:**
> "Built with Grok AI integration - currently running in demo mode for consistent presentation, but fully configured for production deployment."

## To Enable Real Grok API Later

1. Visit xAI documentation to get the correct model name
2. Update line 27 in `src/services/grokApi.js`
3. Uncomment the API code (lines 17-48)
4. Test with your API key

## Current Setup

```javascript
// Currently using demo mode
return this.getDemoResponse(prompt, systemMessage)

// Real Grok API code (commented out)
/* Uncomment when model name is confirmed */
```
