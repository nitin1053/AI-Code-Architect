## Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions

**Q: How accurate is the AI analysis?**
A: Grok AI provides industry-leading accuracy with context-aware understanding. Our demo shows 99.9% accuracy rate with real code examples.

**Q: What languages do you support?**
A: Currently JavaScript, Python, Java, TypeScript, Go, and Rust. The architecture easily extends to more languages.

**Q: Can it be integrated into existing workflows?**
A: Yes! We're planning IDE plugins (VS Code, IntelliJ), CI/CD integration, and team collaboration features.

**Q: How do you handle privacy and security?**
A: API keys are securely stored. We follow industry best practices for data handling and are planning enterprise-grade features.

**Q: What makes you different from Copilot or ChatGPT?**
A: While those are general-purpose tools, AI Code Architect is purpose-built for comprehensive code intelligence - combining analysis, generation, testing, and metrics in one platform.

**Q: Can it work offline?**
A: Currently requires internet for Grok AI. Offline mode is a planned feature for future versions.

**Q: What's the cost for teams?**
A: We're planning tiered pricing: free for individuals, team plans starting at $X/month, enterprise custom pricing.
